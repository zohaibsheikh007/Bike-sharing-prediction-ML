The introduction of rental bikes in urban cities has significantly improved mobility comfort,
offering a convenient mode of transportation for the public. To ensure the success of this service,
it is crucial to make rental bikes available and accessible to the public at the right time, 
reducing waiting times and enhancing the overall user experience. However,
one of the main challenges in managing a bike rental system is the prediction of the number of bikes required at each hour to maintain a stable supply of rental bikes. 

This project aims to address this challenge by utilizing a dataset that includes various weather-related parameters (such as temperature, humidity, windspeed, visibility, dewpoint, solar radiation, snowfall, and rainfall), 
as well as data on the number of bikes rented per hour and date information.
